# Breez SDK - Spark

## **Overview**

The Breez SDK provides developers with an end-to-end solution for integrating instant, non-custodial bitcoin into their apps and services.
It eliminates the need for third parties, simplifies the complexities of Bitcoin and Lightning, and enables seamless onboarding for billions of users to the future of value transfer.

**The Breez SDK is free for developers.**

## **What is the Breez SDK - Spark?**

It’s a nodeless integration that offers a non-custodial, end-to-end solution for integrating bitcoin, utilizing the Bitcoin-native Layer 2 Lightning & Spark, with on-chain interoperability. Using the Breez SDK, you’ll be able to:

- **Send payments** via various protocols such as: Lightning address, LNURL-Pay, Bolt11, BTC address, Spark address

## Getting Started 

Head over to the [Breez SDK documentation](https://sdk-doc-spark.breez.technology/) to start implementing bitcoin in your app.

You'll need an API key to use the Breez SDK. To request an API key is free - you just need to [complete this simple form](https://breez.technology/request-api-key/#contact-us-form-sdk).


## **API**

API documentation is [here](https://breez.github.io/spark-sdk/breez_sdk_spark/index.html).


## **Command Line**

The [Breez SDK - Spark cli](https://github.com/breez/spark-sdk/tree/main/crates/breez-sdk/cli) is a command line client that allows you to interact with and test the functionality of the SDK.

## How does the Breez SDK - Spark work?

The Breez SDK uses Spark, a Bitcoin-native Layer 2 built on a shared signing protocol, to enable real-time, low-fee, self-custodial payments.

When sending a payment, Spark delegates the transfer of on-chain bitcoin to the recipient through a multi-signature process.
Spark Operators help facilitate the transfer, but they cannot move funds without the user. This allows the payment to settle almost instantly, without requiring a blockchain confirmation.

When receiving a payment, the same process works in reverse: the network updates ownership of the bitcoin to the user through the shared signing system, recording the change off-chain while always keeping the funds secure.

Unlike blockchains, rollups, or smart contracts, Spark doesn’t create a new ledger or require trust in external consensus.
On Bitcoin’s main chain, Spark transactions appear as a series of multi-sig wallets. Off-chain, Spark keeps a lightweight record of balances and history.

Funds are non-custodial: you can exit Spark at any time and reclaim your bitcoin directly on the Bitcoin main chain.
